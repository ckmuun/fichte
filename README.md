Welcome to FICHTE! 

General note:
This is a work in progress which I work on during my freetime. Please do not consider this finished and/or production-grade software.

FICHTE stands for Flower Image Classification Human and Technology Experiment ('Fichte' is the german word for a spruce tree)

This project is about classifying six types of flowers from the relatively well-known flowers dataset from kaggle.com.
However, this is not a data science project in the traditional sense, although ML classification with Apache Spark is part of it.
This project is about how classification of documents (images in this case) by machines and classification by humans can be combined into one application.

The idea is that many ML applications do quite fine in handling common cases during document classification, but struggle with edge cases and junk documents. FICHTE aims to create an application that integrates ML and humans as seamlessly as possible.
